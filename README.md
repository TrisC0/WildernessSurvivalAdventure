# WildernessSurvivalAdventure

About The Game
Wilderness Survival Adventure is a retro-style, top-down 2D survival game built entirely in a single HTML file with JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.

You play as a researcher whose plane has crashed in an uncharted, procedurally generated wilderness. With your radio broken, your only hope for rescue is to find and reactivate three ancient monoliths scattered across the land, which are rumored to emit a powerful energy signal.

Explore a vast, randomly generated world, gather resources, craft essential tools, hunt for food, and survive the dangers of the wild, especially after the sun goes down.

Features
Infinite Replayability: The world is procedurally generated with a random, natural shape and a surrounding mountain range for every new game.

Dynamic Day/Night Cycle: The world changes as time passes. Nights are more dangerous, with an increased number of aggressive animals, but they also bring unique resources like the glowing Moonpetal Flower.

Deep Survival Mechanics: Manage your Health, Hunger, and Energy. You'll need to find food, cook it, and rest to stay alive.

Robust Crafting System: Gather wood and stone to craft essential tools like axes and pickaxes, a sword for defense, and survival items like campfires and tents.

Engaging Storyline: Embark on a quest to find and activate three mysterious monoliths by providing them with rare offerings. Your survival depends on it!

Combat System: Defend yourself from aggressive wolves. Craft a sword to fight back more effectively.

Hunting & Cooking: Hunt wolves for raw meat, then cook it over a campfire for a substantial meal that restores both health and hunger.

Resource Gathering: Chop down trees, mine rocks, forage for berries, and discover rare items like Ancient Gems.
